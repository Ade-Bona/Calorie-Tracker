# Tracalorie App

This is a simple calorie counter app built with vanilla JavaScript. It tracks your meals and workouts and calculates the total calories burned and consumed.

All of the code/classes are in the `app.js` file.

There is a version of this app built with Webpack in the `webpack` branch.
